# AuthorshipDApp: Decentralized Proof of Authorship 📝🔗

**AuthorshipDApp** is a personal Proof of Concept (POC) designed to explore the use of **blockchain** technology for **registering** and **verifying content authorship**. Users can securely register their original works—such as **articles**, **code**, or other creative content—on the blockchain, creating an **immutable proof of authorship** that is **transparent**, **secure**, and **verifiable**. 🚀🔐

The goal of this project is to understand how blockchain can be leveraged to protect **intellectual property** and establish **verifiable ownership** of digital content 🧠💡. Through this hands-on approach, the project aims to provide insight into how **decentralized systems** can be used for **proof of ownership** and **content verification** in the digital world 🌍⚖️.
